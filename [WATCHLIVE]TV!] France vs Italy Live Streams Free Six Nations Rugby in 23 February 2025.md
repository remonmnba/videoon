France players train at the Stadio Olimpico before facing Italy in the Six Nations

No excuses: France cannot afford to slip up against Italy in Rome if they want to win the Six Nations

Italy host France as Six Nations third-round weekend draws to an exciting close in Rome today. Les Bleus make the trip to the Stadio Olimpico desperate to bounce back quickly from their shock last-gasp defeat by England at Twickenham a fortnight ago that scuppered their latest Grand Slam hopes and made Ireland strong favourites to win a historic and unprecedented third successive title.

With a massive clash in Dublin coming up next and the defending champions having survived a surprise scare of their own against resurgent Wales yesterday, there is simply no more margin for error for Fabien Galthie’s wounded side, who will be eager to produce a statement victory this afternoon. However, Italy are no pushovers and deservedly beat Wales last time out to hasten the end of Warren Gatland’s dismal second reign having fought back admirably before losing to Scotland at Murrayfield on opening weekend.

The Azzurri almost pulled off a massive upset in this fixture in Lille 12 months ago, only for Paolo Garbisi’s last-gasp penalty attempt to agonisingly bobble off the tee and then hit the post in a thrilling 13-13 draw. Follow Italy vs France live below!

Fabien Galthie reveals Damian Penaud talks after France axe
It remains to be seen how much of a future Matthieu Jailibert has for France under Fabien Galthie, having now been dropped after a one-game return that followed his leaving the squad in the autumn having not been selected to face the All Blacks.

He and Damian Penaud both look set to play for Bordeaux against Clermont in the Top 14 tonight after both being released back to the club.

Addressing the decision to drop star wing Penaud entirely for the trip to Rome, Galthie said this week: “I spent two hours with Damian on Tuesday at the end of the afternoon, talking, listening to him, sharing.

“We absolutely have to be in harmony even if I understand that it is never easy for a competitor, for a champion, to accept, to take in the decision.”

Fabien Galthie explains controversial 7-1 France bench split
Fabien Galthie wasn’t giving too much away in terms of that much talked about and controversial 7-1 bench split so famously used by Rassie Erasmus and South Africa in the 2023 World Cup final against New Zealand in Paris, and on other occasions since then.

It rather suggests that total physicality across the full 80 minutes will be the primary French approach in Rome this afternoon, which should draw in defenders and tee up ample chances for their stylish finishers in talented young wing pair Louis Bielle-Biarrey and Theo Attissogbe.

It is also apparently designed to combat areas where France deem Italy to be the strongest.

“First of all, it’s tactical,” Galthie said. “I can’t go too much into the strategy and reveal it, but it’s to do with how we have analysed our opponent since Gonzalo Quesada took charge.

“We chose to test out a strategy to counter the key areas in which the Italians perform enormously well. That is to say their ground game.

“It’s true that it comes with a risk.”
